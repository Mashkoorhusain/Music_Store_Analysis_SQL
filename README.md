# Music Store Data Analysis with SQL

## Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis of a music store database using SQL. The goal is to derive meaningful insights about sales, customer behavior, and store performance by writing complex SQL queries.

## Tools & Technologies
- **SQL** (used for querying and analyzing the dataset)
- **PostgreSQL** (specify the database you used)

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple tables, including:
- **Customers**: Information about customers, including location and purchase history.
- **Invoices**: Details of purchases made by customers.
- **Invoice_Lists**: Breakdown of purchased items.
- **Tracks**: Information about the songs available in the store.
- **Albums**: Album details including the artist and release year.
- **Artists**: List of artists available in the store.
- **Genres**: Different music genres in the store.
- **Employees**: Sales representatives and store staff details.

## Key Insights
Some of the insights gained from the analysis include:
-  The **most popular music genres** based on sales.
-  The **top-grossing artists and albums** in the store.
-  **Sales performance per store** and comparison between branches.
-  **Customer purchasing behavior**, including high-value customers and frequent buyers.
-  **Geographic distribution of customers** and sales trends in different regions.
-  **Employee performance analysis** to identify the top-performing sales representatives.

## SQL Queries
I used advanced SQL techniques such as:
- **Aggregate Functions** (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.)
- **Joins** (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.)
- **Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
- **Window Functions** (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER)
- **CASE Statements** for conditional logic
